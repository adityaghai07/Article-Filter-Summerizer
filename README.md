# Article Searcher and Summarizer

This project is an article searcher and summarizer developed during the OpenHack Hackathon at IISC Bangalore. It utilizes The General News Dataset from Kaggle to retrieve relevant articles and employs collaborative filtering techniques. The project leverages standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization for NLP tasks. The summarization aspect is powered by Hugging Face's pipelines with the Facebook BART model. 

## Features

- **Article Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant articles from The General News Dataset using collaborative filtering techniques.
- **NLP Preprocessing**: Implement tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization for text preprocessing.
- **Summarization**: Summarize articles using Hugging Face's pipelines with the Facebook BART model.
- **Comprehensive Tool**: Incorporates fundamental NLP principles to provide a comprehensive tool for article searching and summarization.
